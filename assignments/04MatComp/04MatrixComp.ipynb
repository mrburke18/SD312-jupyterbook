    "This lab is a precursor to the \"big\" lab we'll do next week on matrix completion.  You will build much of the infrastructure for this assignment this week.  We will use our very small foods dataset to make sure all our code runs properly.  In some ways, this dataset is perfect for development - it is small, so our code will run fast, and the matrix is quite dense - that is, there aren't many missing data points.\n",
