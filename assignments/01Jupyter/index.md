# Data Exploration

A crucial first step in any data analysis task is just to create some simple
statistics and visualizations just to explore the data. Plot things. Look at
distributions. Sanity check things. This can inform you immensely, while
helping you identify errors in data that could throw off results, saving you lots and lots of debug time later.

[Here is a datset of midshipman grades in core classes over the past several
years](grades.csv). Download it, and answer the following questions. We will
perform this assignment as individuals.

- Calculate the median grade in each of the courses.
- Find the three classes with the most Ds and Fs.
- Find the three classes with the most As.
- Choose three classes of interest to you. Plot histograms of the grades in those three classes.
- Read about [Pearson's correlation
  coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient).
Choose a course. Calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient between
performance in that course and performance in all the other courses. In your
own words, write a paragraph explaining what these numbers mean. Additionally,
explain: Are there any surprises? Are any classes negatively correlated with
it? Do these results make sense to you?
- Ask, and answer, at least one other interesting question related to this
  dataset.
