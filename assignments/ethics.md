# Ethical Essay

Every new powerful tool introduces both opportunities and risks, and, therefore, ethical dilemmas.  Your assignment is to choose an ethical dilemma related to the class material, and write an essay which uses the [Moral Deliberation Roadmap](moralDeliberationRoadmap.pdf) from your ethics core class to work through the dilemma and determine an ethical conclusion.  Second, argue an ethical *practical* position.  *Who* should be held responsible for doing *what* by *whom* in order to promote a more just outcome?  Justify how that mechanism will result in the desired outcome, and will be worth any negative repercussions.  You can write about whatever you like, but naturally, I get more excited reading a paper about a topic of interest to you, rather than one I brought up.

There is no page limit or requirement.  Make it however long it needs to be to clearly argue and justify your position, and no longer.

**You may not use generative AI to write this essay.**  Only turn in your own work, please.

Every instructor looks for slightly different things in writing!  As fair warning, here's my pet peeves.

- Good spelling and grammar matter.  Poor spelling and grammar makes you come across as unprofessional and unclear.
- Unnecessary, word-padding cruft is very high school ("since the dawn of time, mankind has grappled with how to behave ethically...").  Clear communication requires that you get to the point, say what you need to say, and get out.
- Arguments need to be justified, either philosophically (like with the roadmap), or with citations.
- If you have citations, I do not care about the citation/bibliography format, as long as it's some clear format (not just a link).
- I'm a strong believer in starting with a plan, writing off that plan, and then editing.  It's usually possible to tell if a writer is figuring things out while they write, and it makes the writing less effective.
