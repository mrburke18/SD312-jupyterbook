    "# Data Science with Python\n",

    "This assignment is straightforward - you'll do some basic analysis to get practice loading and working with data using a Jupyter notebook and these various Python packages that you installed.  Your laptop should be sufficient for working with this data, though you're welcome to use the ssh server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you're welcome to use a generative AI like ChatGPT.  They tend to do pretty well in response to prompts like \"use pandas and plotly to create a bar graph...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### To start Jupyter...\n",
    "...run `jupyter notebook`.  You'll notice your browser gets all excited and pops up a new window.  A Jupyter notebook allows for text in Markdown format, python code, images, etc.  It's a great format for telling a story that involves code/graphs, etc.  There are a whole bunch of Jupyter tutorials out there that are worth doing.  [I like this one, which also introduces pandas and some matplotlib](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).\n",

    "# The assignment\n",
    "Pharmacies have to have a stock of opiates on hand for filling prescriptions. The DEA tracks every purchase of opiate pills made by pharamacies to replentish their stock. Recently, due to the legal efforts of the Washington Post and the Charleston Gazette-Mail, this database of opiate purchases was made public, and was published by the Washington Post for general download and analysis. The database covers 178.5 million purchases of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills from 2006-2014, for a total of more than 100 billion pills.  [You can read more about this dataset here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As policymakers confront America's opiate problem, this dataset provides important clues to where the problem exists. [You can see a list of local news stories from around the country based on this dataset here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/08/12/post-released-deas-data-pain-pills-heres-what-local-journalists-are-using-it/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the dataset.  Here, I use pandas to read in the statewide data for Maryland, and look at the first five lines."
