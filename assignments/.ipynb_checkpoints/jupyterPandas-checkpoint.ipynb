    "# Data Science with Python, Due September 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common languages for processing data are Python and R.  We're going to be using Python.  Python has a lot of problems.  It's slow and it's undisciplined, making it poorly suited for large software projects.  However, it's fast for the programmer, and we can sidestep the \"undisciplined\" problem by noting that most data science projects don't require that much programming - it's just a little bit of programming applied to large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that it's slow is still a problem when processing those large data sets.  The scientific computing community has gotten around this by writing a large number of very impressive libraries for data science that are written in C, but which provide an API for Python.  This lets the programmer direct what will happen in an easy-to-code language, while having all the computationally expensive parts happen in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the \"right\" way to program for data science in Python is by using the libraries as much as possible, and doing as little as possible in pure Python - so we have to know how these libraries work (or at least, know how to look up how these libraries work - Google and Stack Overflow will be key throughout this course!).  The libraries we'll be using include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pandas`: useful for loading and manipulating datasets\n",
    "- `numpy`: used for linear algebra\n",
    "- `scipy`: data structures and algorithms for scientific computing\n",
    "- `matplotlib`: matlab-like plotting\n",
    "- `sklearn`: machine learning algorithms\n",
    "- `jupyter notebook`: useful for making reports that include text, images, code, and graphs.\n",
    "- `h5py`: used for accessing HDF5 files, a high-density file format often used to store arrays on HPC systems\n",
    "- `mpi4py`: those of you in HPC who want to slap some MPI on your projects are welcome to use this Python wrapper around MPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably, we'll come up with some others, too.  For this project, we're going to focus on pandas, matplotlib, and jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The first step...\n",
    "...is to install all this business.  [The easiest way is to install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), a full Python distribution with many scientific computing libraries, which is installed in your home directory, so you never have to invoke administrator priviledges to add to it (this is especially nice if working on a system where you don't *have* administrator priviledges).\n",
    "\n",
    "As it installs, say \"yes\" to everything.  When it's done, when you make a new shell, and run `which python`, it should indicate the Anaconda install.  Your shell prompt should change, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, run `conda install jupyter notebook numpy scipy matplotlib h5py mpi4py scikit-learn pandas`.  That should install all these libraries (most will already be there).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want to do this on all the machines you intend to work on.  At minimum, this will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your  laptop\n",
    "- midn.cs.usna.edu (Note the course resources page has instructions on how to run a notebook remotely, like on midn, but view it and interact with it locally, like on your laptop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### To start Jupyter...\n",
    "...run `jupyter notebook`.  You'll notice your browser gets all excited and pops up a new window.  A Jupyter notebook allows for text in Markdown format, python code, images, etc.  It's a great format for telling a story that involves code/graphs, etc.  There are a whole bunch of Jupyter tutorials out there that are worth doing.  [I like this one, which also introduces pandas and some matplotlib](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/).\n",
    "\n",
    "# The assignment\n",
    "Pharmacies have to have a stock of opiates on hand for filling prescriptions. The DEA tracks every purchase of opiate pills made by pharamacies to replentish their stock. Recently, due to the legal efforts of the Washington Post and the Charleston Gazette-Mail, this database of opiate purchases was made public, and was published by the Washington Post for general download and analysis. The database covers 178.5 million purchases of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills from 2006-2014, for a total of more than 100 billion pills.  [You can read more about this dataset here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As policymakers confront America's opiate problem, this dataset provides important clues to where the problem exists. [You can see a list of local news stories from around the country based on this dataset here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/08/12/post-released-deas-data-pain-pills-heres-what-local-journalists-are-using-it/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the dataset.  Here, I use pandas to read in the statewide data for Maryland, and look at the first five lines."
