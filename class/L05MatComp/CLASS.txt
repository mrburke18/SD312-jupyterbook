Start by going through 04Soln.  Answer and demo the qualitative questions.  When should we stop training?

Talk about how to choose hyperparameters.  Emphasize that hyperparameters are chosen to minimize test error - for each hyperparameter choice, do the very best you can to optimize test error (for example, maybe the best stepsize changes, etc.), then compare those best efforts.

Mention that it's best to make sure it works for one setting of hyperparameters, then make it a function that you can call on a loop (or in parallel), and walk away and let it run.

Talk about a validation set in reporting accuracy.

Introduce the in-class exercise.
