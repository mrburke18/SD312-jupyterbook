Talk through hard questions from the exam.

Walk through online notes.

Show Classification.ipynb, which walks through making a simple neural net for mnist, a multiclass classification problem.

A couple different things:
- one-hot labeling
- The oopsie on not mentioning `to('cuda')` before now. Needs to happen to data and the model.
- Adam (briefly just mention momentum in SGD)
- step by step through softmax
- using nn.Softmax
- calculation of predLabels is non-obvious
- confusion matrix is likely new
- the train/test split with dataloaders
