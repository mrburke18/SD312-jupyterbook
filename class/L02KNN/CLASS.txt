Introduce dataset. Make sure they see where the small one is, and talk about
how we always develop on a smaller version of the dataset to save time.

Lean on the idea that they need to be able to go from column of their matrix
to name of the movie.  So if I say column 2, that means the 3rd column, and
produce the name of the movie with its ratings in that column.

After a while, when they start getting to the nearestneighbors thing, walk
through an example from the api, demonstrating how to read an api.  Run the
simple example.  Talk about what .fit is doing vs .kneighbors.

Hopefully they notice it's working on -rows- and we want it to work on
-columns-.  If not, point it out to them.  Show it's just a transpose.
