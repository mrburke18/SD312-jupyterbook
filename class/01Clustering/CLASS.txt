SM317 ended with unsupervised learning. CDR Matthews felt you-all didn't understand the significance of it.
We're going to pick up there. Unsupervised is one of the most common things to do - most data is unlabeled.
Most data science starts with "here's some data. Do something with it." Unsupervised learning is a useful place to start to understand the data.

Review of what clustering is. Walk through what we want from clustering, and how what we want leads to a reasonable objective function for k-means. Write up objective function.

Now we need to solve this.  How do we? Can't, actually. Np-hard. So we solve it approximately, many times, and keep the best version.

Remind the algorithm for solving k-means.

What assumptions did we make?  We assumed K.  Do we know if we're right?  Do we like our clusters? We don't really know, it's just exploratory.

Go through clustering exploration notebook.  Gauge what they know about pandas/sklearn/plotly/jupyter notebooks
