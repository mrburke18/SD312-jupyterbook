# Guidance for project submissions

Your project is intended to be a *report*, not *code*.  Assume your audience is a person who understands the material that has been taught, and is familiar with the assignment, but has not looked closely at the data, does not particularly want to, and doesn't want to read your code to understand what you did.  As such, you do not need to introduce class concepts or the assignment, but it should be easily understood, in text, what you did, and what the results were.  In other words, I want to *read* and look at your graphs, and only look at your code if something is fishy or unclear.

Your projects may sometimes be PDFs of Word or Google Doc documents, or they may be HTML files of Jupyter notebooks.  They are not, themselves, Word or google doc documents, or .ipynb files, as they're harder to read.

**Remember to have a statement describing the amount, and type, of generative AI used in your project.**

When your projects are graded, the following will be considered:

- Did you do the assignment as described?
- Did you correctly use class concepts?
- Is your report easy to read?
- Do I understand everything you tried, and what worked and what didn't?
- Were you creative and curious?
