title: Read LFD 3.1.1 and 3.4, stopping at "VC Bound"

*Note: $E_{in}$ refers to the error on the training set, and $E_{out}$ refers to
the error on the testing set.*

- What problem does the "pocket algorithm" solve that the classical perceptron
  could not?
- What is "the Z space" and $\Phi$?  How can this help us solve the same
  problem as the pocket algorithm, in a very different way?
