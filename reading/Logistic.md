**Read LFD 3.3.0-3.3.1**

(Reading 3.3.2 is not required, and is review, but is a good, well-written review. It is probably worth your time.)

This reading is about logistic regression, which, ironically, does not solve regression problems, but is instead a classifier. Rather than just predicting a class, it uses a linear model to predict the probability of the data point being in a class.

- Perceptrons and logistic regression are both linear approaches to classification. What is the difference between the output of a perceptron, and the output of a logistic regressor?
- What does *likelihood* and *maximum likelihood* mean in this context?
- We will go over the derivation of equation 3.9.  Look at 3.9 - make sure you understand how a "more correct" $w$ corresponds to a smaller $E_{in}$.
