**Read MML 2.5 (until the mention of Gaussian elimination), and 2.6**

For this reading, it is important to know the term *vector space*.  Suppose we have some set of vectors (for example, $\textbf{v}_1, \textbf{v}_2, \textbf{v}_3$).  We can choose three coefficients $c_1$, $c_2$, and $c_3$, and make a linear combination: $c_1\textbf{v}_1+c_2\textbf{v}_2+c_3\textbf{v}_3$ and produce a fourth vector.  Of course, if we change $c_1$, $c_2$, and/or $c_3$, we would get a different resulting vector.  The set of all vectors that can be produced through arbitrary coefficients is called the *vector space* of $\{\textbf{v}_1,\textbf{v}_2,\textbf{v}_3\}$.

After your reading, for any two of the following list, be able to say what the relationship is between them. 

- vector space
- linear combinations
- linear dependence
- rank
- generating sets
- basis
