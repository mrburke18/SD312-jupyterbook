title: Read ISL 9.2, 9.3.1 and 9.3.2
---

- Understand what overfitting and underfitting in classification looks like.
- Be able to interpret equations 9.12-9.15.
- Be able to explain how C interacts with this optimization problem to act as a regularizer.
- Section 9.3.2 talks about the inner products of the observations (ie, rows of the data matrix). What is the size of a dot product between data points with 5 features? 10 features? a million features?
- A *kernel* is a similarity function between two data points. A dot product between the features of two data points is one such kernel. What other kernels are mentioned in the reading?
- In standard linear classification, we choose features to add expressiveness. In SVMs, what do we choose instead?
