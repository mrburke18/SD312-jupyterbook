title: Read RL 1.3, 1.4, 6.5
---

This section should be review for you.  It's important to know/remember:

- What an RL problem is.
- What is measured for each sample in RL.
- How RL differs from supervised learning.
- What our source of supervision is - that is, what do we "know," and how can we use that to learn something useful?
- How tabular Q-learning works on a discrete state space with a discrete action space.
