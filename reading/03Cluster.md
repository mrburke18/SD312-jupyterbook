- What kind of problem is clustering?
- If using k-means, what property does a good clustering solution have?
- Be able to explain equation 10.11.
- Why does k-means clustering have to be run multiple times? What changes from run to run, and why?
- What advantage does hierarchical clustering have over k-means?
- Be able to explain a dendogram.
- How does hierarchical clustering work?
- The **details** of K-Means are very important.  The **general idea** of Heirarchical Clustering is sufficient.
- "Small Decisions with Big Consequences" and "A Tempered..." are very important.
