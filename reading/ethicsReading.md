# First readings for ethics discussions

Our next unit is about the ethical decisions surrounding machine learning and
data management. As with all powerful tools, AI provides opportunities for
both help and harm, and there are decisions to be made on what opportunities
and restrictions should be built around it. As individuals with training in
both ML and ethical decision making, you are uniquely suited to think about
these topics.

My goal in our discussions about ethics is to promote learning through free
discussion. We will promote this free discussion through the following rules:

- As discussed in the course policy, we will follow the Chatham Rule - if you
  have any discussion about our class conversation, you will not attribute any
  comments to any individual. Names are left out of it.
- Even if we disagree vehemently, we will always assume good intentions from
  our classmates. We may think our classmates wrong, but not mean.
- We will work hard to keep an open mind. If your mind changes about some
  issue, you will have succeeded. If you hear an opposing argument, grapple
  with it meaningfully, and come out more sure of yourself, you will have
  succeeded. If you do neither, but "win the argument," you will have failed.
- All perspectives are welcome, especially opposing ones.
- I may at times argue a position. You should interpret this as an attempt to
  interject some considerations, arguments, or perspectives that are otherwise
  missing from the conversation, and not an attempt to use my authority to
  convince you to my argued perspective. I have at times argued both sides of
  an argument!

Our first discussion will be about privacy and data control. Read these
articles:

- [Surveillance in
  Kashgar](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/04/world/asia/xinjiang-china-surveillance-prison.html).
It is possible you will not have access to this article, with changes in
library access. Try, and if you can't watch it, we'll watch it in class.
- [Immigration agents have new technology to identify and track
  people](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/08/nx-s1-5585691/ice-facial-recognition-immigration-tracking-spyware).
- [What Palantir
  Sees](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/opinion/palantir-shyam-sankar-military.html?unlocked_article_code=1.0U8.EJOf.HiraQzIx99eN&smid=url-share)

In class we'll discuss many elements of these articles, including questions
and thoughts of your own. In preparation, think in particular about the
following questions:

- Security and privacy have always been, to some incomplete degree, in
  opposition. A policeman standing on the corner watches the community, taking
  away some of their privacy in exchange for their security. ITSD intercepts all
  your internet traffic with the intent of identifying insider threats. What do
  we lose when we give up privacy? What do we gain?
- The Palantir article includes a discussion between the interviewer and the
  interviewee about possible value in inefficiently or incompletely enforcing
  rules and laws. Are there rules in your life that are not completely enforced?
  How would your life change if they were completely enforced?
